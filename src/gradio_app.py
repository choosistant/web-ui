I was able to score the tv + frame for $999 together on Black Friday and I‚Äôm so glad I did because paying $150~ ish dollars for the plastic frames is really annoying when you discover that the poor packaging design means they arrive broken!! Go look at the reviews for the optional Samsung frames. If you‚Äôre patient and deal with the returns and reorder until it‚Äôs right it will work out but you‚Äôve been warned okay?Alright all that aside the TV is gorgeous.\nI‚Äôm so happy with it. Picture quality is good my only complaint is that the screen should be more anti-reflective. It‚Äôs not as reflective as straight glass but with any lamps or windows you might be annoyed by the glare If you‚Äôre a design snob/observant enough in the first place to be looking at this tv. Regardless of the glare and the stupid overpriced bezels (which IMO are completely necessary if you want this tv since the whole point is to look like a frame) I would still repurchase because it‚Äôs just stunning to look at.Also the art subscription- just don‚Äôt.There‚Äôs not enough art to warrant $5 a month and you can upload your own pictures (of artwork that you can find on google for FREE) to the TV via the smart things app.They‚Äôve shorted the free subscription to ONE month with a new tv purchase and it‚Äôs still not worth it. Just google your favorite art, save it in a high quality resolution and voil√†."
